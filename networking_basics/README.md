# Networking Basics

##  Understanding the OSI Model:

To comprehend networking fundamentals, it's essential to become familiar with the OSI (Open Systems Interconnection) model. This model standardizes communication between network protocols, dividing it into seven layers, each with its own set of protocols. You'll often hear references to specific layers like "it operates at the third layer." Here are the seven layers of the OSI moel:


![osi-model](https://github.com/Shreyank031/Documentation/assets/115367978/eb4673ad-c35a-445b-9196-09042eac8f00)


1. **Physical Layer**: This layer deals with hardware-level communication, including the actual transmission of data over wired or wireless mediums. Examples of protocols at this layer include Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, and DSL.

   - The main functionality of the physical layer is to transmit the individual bits from one node to another node.
   - It is the lowest layer of the OSI model.
   - It establishes, maintains and deactivates the physical connection.
   - It specifies the mechanical, electrical and procedural network interface specifications.

**Functions of a Physical layer:**

- **Line Configuration**: It defines the way how two or more devices can be connected physically.
- **Data Transmission**: It defines the transmission mode whether it is simplex, half-duplex or full-duplex mode between the two devices on the network.
- **Topology**: It defines the way how network devices are arranged.
- **Signals**: It determines the type of the signal used for transmitting the information.


2. **Data Link Layer**: Responsible for transmitting data between two devices within the same network.
- Data is encapsulated in frames, which contain the physical addresses of both the sender and receiver, known as MAC (Media Access Control) addresses.
- Every device, including your laptop, has a NIC (Network Interface Controller) responsible for sending and receiving frames.
- Each NIC has a unique MAC address, typically embedded in hardware or generated by a virtualization system. Devices may have multiple NICs for various purposes.

3.  **Network Layer**: At this layer, IP addresses are used instead of MAC addresses.
- It determines the best path to move data from source to the destination based on the network conditions, the priority of service, and other factors.
- The Data link layer is responsible for routing and forwarding the packets.
- IP addressing enables communication between devices across different networks.
- To view your device's IP addresses, you can use the ip addr show command.
- IP addresses are represented in CIDR notation, indicating the number of bits in the network mask.
- This notation helps determine the size of address blocks and the number of addresses within them.

**Functions of Network Layer:**

- **Internetworking**: An internetworking is the main responsibility of the network layer. It provides a logical connection between different devices.
- **Addressing**: A Network layer adds the source and destination address to the header of the frame. Addressing is used to identify the device on the internet.
- **Routing**: Routing is the major component of the network layer, and it determines the best optimal path out of the multiple paths from source to the destination.
- **Packetizing**: A Network Layer receives the `segments` from the upper layer and converts them into `packets`. This process is known as Packetizing. It is achieved by internet protocol (IP).

4. **Transport Layer**: Responsible for end-to-end communication and data segmentation. Key protocols at this layer include TCP (Transmission Control Protocol) and UDP (User Datagram Protocol).
- The Transport layer is a Layer 4 ensures that messages are transmitted in the order in which they are sent and there is no duplication of data.
- The main responsibility of the transport layer is to transfer the data completely.
- It receives the data from the upper layer and converts them into smaller units known as segments.
- This layer can be termed as an end-to-end layer as it provides a point-to-point connection between source and destination to deliver the data reliably. 


<img width="766" alt="trasport-layer" src="https://github.com/Shreyank031/Documentation/assets/115367978/68836fae-f611-4300-92fe-2f7d233698c6">


#### The two protocols used in this layer are:

- **Transmission Control Protocol**
   - It is a standard protocol that allows the systems to communicate over the internet.
   - It establishes and maintains a connection between hosts.
   - When data is sent over the TCP connection, then the TCP protocol divides the data into smaller units known as segments. 
   - Each segment travels over the internet using multiple routes, and they arrive in different orders at the destination. The transmission control protocol reorders the packets in the correct order at the receiving end.

- **User Datagram Protocol**
    - User Datagram Protocol is a transport layer protocol.
    - It is an unreliable transport protocol as in this case receiver does not send any acknowledgment when the packet is received, the sender does not wait for any acknowledgment. Therefore, this makes a protocol unreliable.

#### Functions of Transport Layer:

- **Service-point addressing**: Computers run several programs simultaneously due to this reason, the transmission of data from source to the destination not only from one computer to another computer but also from one process to another process. The transport layer adds the header that contains the address known as a service-point address or port address. The responsibility of the network layer is to transmit the data from one computer to another computer and the responsibility of the transport layer is to transmit the message to the correct process.

 - **Segmentation and reassembly**: When the transport layer receives the message from the upper layer, it divides the message into multiple segments, and each segment is assigned with a sequence number that uniquely identifies each segment. When the message has arrived at the destination, then the transport layer reassembles the message based on their sequence numbers.

5. **Session Layer**: Manages sessions or connections between devices, ensuring data exchange in an organized manner.
- It is a layer 3 in the OSI model.
- The Session layer is used to establish, maintain and synchronizes the interaction between communicating devices.

#### Functions of Session layer:

- **Dialog control**: Session layer acts as a dialog/session controller that creates a dialog/session between two processes or we can say that it allows the communication between two processes which can be either half-duplex or full-duplex.

- **Synchronization**: Session layer adds some checkpoints when transmitting the data in a sequence. If some error occurs in the middle of the transmission of data, then the transmission will take place again from the checkpoint. This process is known as Synchronization and recovery.


6. **Presentation Layer**: Responsible for data formatting, encryption, and compression, ensuring data is in a suitable format for transmission.
- A Presentation layer is mainly concerned with the syntax and semantics of the information exchanged between the two systems.
- It acts as a data translator for a network.
- This layer is a part of the operating system that converts the data from one presentation format to another format.
- The Presentation layer is also known as the syntax layer.


<img width="766" alt="presentation-layer" src="https://github.com/Shreyank031/Documentation/assets/115367978/f1828e37-6861-4dee-adbb-05f21dc8a002">



#### Functions of Presentation layer:

- **Translation**: The processes in two systems exchange the information in the form of character strings, numbers and so on. Different computers use different encoding methods, the presentation layer handles the interoperability between the different encoding methods. It converts the data from sender-dependent format into a common format and changes the common format into receiver-dependent format at the receiving end.

- **Encryption**: Encryption is needed to maintain privacy. Encryption is a process of converting the sender-transmitted information into another form and sends the resulting message over the network.

- **Compression**: Data compression is a process of compressing the data, i.e., it reduces the number of bits to be transmitted. Data compression is very important in multimedia such as text, audio, video.



7. **Application Layer**: The top layer that interacts directly with users or applications. It includes protocols like HTTP, FTP, and SMTP. For example, browsers can communicate using HyperText Transfer Protocol Secure (HTTPS), and HTTP and email clients can communicate using POP3 (Post Office Protocol version 3) and SMTP (Simple Mail Transfer Protocol).

- An application layer serves as a window for users and application processes to access network service.
- It handles issues such as network transparency, resource allocation, etc.
- An application layer is not an application, but it performs the application layer functions.
- This layer provides the network services to the end-users.

#### Functions of Application layer:

- **File transfer, access, and management (FTAM)**: An application layer allows a user to access the files in a remote computer, to retrieve the files from a computer and to manage the files in a remote computer.
- **Mail services**: An application layer provides the facility for email forwarding and storage.
- **Directory services**: An application provides the distributed database sources and is used to provide that global information about various objects.


## Exploring Network Devices

### Switches:

A switch is a fundamental networking device used to connect multiple machines within a local area network (LAN). It operates at the data link layer (Layer 2) and forwards data frames from one MAC address to another, effectively building the network. Switches play a crucial role in creating LANs by connecting devices through their ports.

### Routers:

Routers operate at the network layer (Layer 3) and connect different networks together. For example, a Wi-Fi router connects devices within your local area network (LAN) to the broader internet. Routers use IP addresses for routing data packets between networks.

### VLANs (Virtual Local Area Networks):

VLANs (Virtual Local Area Networks) are used to logically separate devices within a single LAN, either for organizational purposes or to establish networks across physically distant locations. VLANs are implemented using switches, which add an additional header with a VLAN tag to frames, determining which network they belong to.

### Bridges:

Bridges operate at Layer 2 and are used to connect two separate networks formed using switches. They enable communication between devices in different network segments.

### Hubs:

Hubs are basic network devices that operate at Layer 1, essentially broadcasting data to all connected devices without distinguishing between them. They are less common today due to their inefficiency compared to switches.

### L3 Switches:

Layer 3 switches, also known as L3 switches, go beyond basic switching capabilities. They can not only forward frames between devices but also perform routing functions. The key difference between a router and an L3 switch lies in the complexity of their operations.

### WAN (Wide Area Network):

Wide Area Networks (WANs) are networks that extend beyond local areas, such as the internet. WANs connect devices across geographical boundaries, enabling global communication.

## Understanding IP Addressing and CIDR

- `IP addresses` are essential for devices to communicate across networks. They come in two main versions: IPv4 and IPv6. IPv4, the older version, uses 32-bit addresses, while IPv6 uses 128-bit addresses to accommodate the growing number of devices connected to the internet.

- **CIDR (Classless Inter-Domain Routing)*8 notation is used to represent IP address ranges. It consists of the IP address followed by a slash and a number, indicating the number of bits in the network mask. For example:

    - 192.168.1.0/24 represents a network with a 24-bit subnet mask, allowing for 256 addresses (2^8).
    - 10.0.0.0/16 represents a network with a 16-bit subnet mask, allowing for 65,536 addresses (2^16).

### DHCP (Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol):

DHCP is used to dynamically assign IP addresses to devices on a network. It simplifies the process of IP address management by automatically providing devices with IP addresses, subnet masks, gateways, and DNS server information.

### DNS (Domain Name System):

DNS translates human-readable domain names into IP addresses. It acts as the internet's phone book, allowing users to access websites and services by name instead of remembering IP addresses.

### NAT (Network Address Translation):

NAT allows multiple devices within a private network to share a single public IP address. It modifies the source or destination IP address in data packets, enabling devices within a private network to communicate with the internet using a single public IP.

### VPN (Virtual Private Network):

VPNs are used to create secure, encrypted connections over the internet. They enable remote users to access private networks as if they were directly connected to the local network. VPNs are essential for secure remote work and protecting data during transmission.

### Firewalls:

Firewalls are network security devices that control incoming and outgoing network traffic based on predefined security rules. They help protect networks and devices from unauthorized access and cyber threats.

### Load Balancers:

Load balancers distribute network traffic across multiple servers to ensure high availability and performance. They are commonly used in web applications to prevent server overload and maintain responsiveness.

## Exploring the Network Protocalls

- **TCP/IP**: The foundational suite of protocols for the internet, consisting of the Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) and the Internet Protocol (IP). TCP ensures reliable data delivery, while IP is responsible for addressing and routing.

- **ARP (Address Resolution Protocol)**: Used to map IP addresses to MAC addresses within a local network.

- **ICMP (Internet Control Message Protocol)**: Used for network diagnostics, including ping requests and error messages.
- **BGP (Border Gateway Protocol)**: The protocol that governs routing on the internet, used by routers to determine the best path for data transmission.

- **SSH (Secure Shell)**: A secure protocol for remote access to network devices and servers.

- **HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol) and HTTPS (HTTP Secure)**: Protocols used for web communication.

- **FTP (File Transfer Protocol)**: Used for transferring files over a network.

- **SMTP (Simple Mail Transfer Protocol)**: Used for sending email messages.

- **POP3 (Post Office Protocol 3) and IMAP (Internet Message Access Protocol)**: Protocols used for retrieving email from servers.
